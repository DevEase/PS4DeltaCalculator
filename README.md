# PS4DeltaCalculator
Find's differences in the PS4's kernel, can search by name or similarity of the function.

Inside there is a scripts folder, which you will use to export the symbolized version of the kernel, and once more for the kernel that does not have symbols, or a different version.

Patterns and masks will automatically be created for you that you can use to resolve functions automatically in the kernel.
